# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer that provides an interactive and educational way to understand how various sorting algorithms work. It uses Matplotlib for creating visualizations and allows users to choose from different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
